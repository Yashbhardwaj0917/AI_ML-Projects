## Introduction

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project focuses on using a Logistic Regression model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, and this project aims to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions among legitimate ones.

## Project Overview

This section provides an overview of the project's structure and key components.

### Project Structure

- `Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.
- `credit_data.csv`: Dataset containing credit card transaction data.
- `README.md`: A detailed README file providing information on how to set up and run the project.

### Dependencies

The project relies on the following libraries and tools:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Data

The project uses the `credit_data.csv` dataset, which contains credit card transaction data, including information about legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for modeling. It includes:

- Handling missing values.
- Creating a balanced dataset by performing under-sampling of legitimate transactions.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involves splitting the data into features (X) and the target variable (Y), which is essential for model training.

## Model Training

The Logistic Regression model is created and trained using the training data to learn patterns and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation involves assessing the accuracy of the trained model on both the training and testing datasets.
